/**
 * --- Day 24: Blizzard Basin ---
 * With everything replanted for next year (and with elephants and monkeys to tend the grove), you and the Elves leave
 * for the extraction point.
 *
 * Partway up the mountain that shields the grove is a flat, open area that serves as the extraction point. It's a bit
 * of a climb, but nothing the expedition can't handle.
 *
 * At least, that would normally be true; now that the mountain is covered in snow, things have become more difficult
 * than the Elves are used to.
 *
 * As the expedition reaches a valley that must be traversed to reach the extraction site, you find that strong,
 * turbulent winds are pushing small blizzards of snow and sharp ice around the valley. It's a good thing everyone
 * packed warm clothes! To make it across safely, you'll need to find a way to avoid them.
 *
 * Fortunately, it's easy to see all of this from the entrance to the valley, so you make a map of the valley and the
 * blizzards (your puzzle input). For example:
 *
 * #.#####
 * #.....#
 * #>....#
 * #.....#
 * #...v.#
 * #.....#
 * #####.#
 * The walls of the valley are drawn as #; everything else is ground. Clear ground - where there is currently no
 * blizzard - is drawn as .. Otherwise, blizzards are drawn with an arrow indicating their direction of motion:
 * up (^), down (v), left (<), or right (>).
 *
 * The above map includes two blizzards, one moving right (>) and one moving down (v). In one minute, each blizzard
 * moves one position in the direction it is pointing:
 *
 * #.#####
 * #.....#
 * #.>...#
 * #.....#
 * #.....#
 * #...v.#
 * #####.#
 * Due to conservation of blizzard energy, as a blizzard reaches the wall of the valley, a new blizzard forms on the
 * opposite side of the valley moving in the same direction. After another minute, the bottom downward-moving blizzard
 * has been replaced with a new downward-moving blizzard at the top of the valley instead:
 *
 * #.#####
 * #...v.#
 * #..>..#
 * #.....#
 * #.....#
 * #.....#
 * #####.#
 * Because blizzards are made of tiny snowflakes, they pass right through each other. After another minute, both
 * blizzards temporarily occupy the same position, marked 2:
 *
 * #.#####
 * #.....#
 * #...2.#
 * #.....#
 * #.....#
 * #.....#
 * #####.#
 * After another minute, the situation resolves itself, giving each blizzard back its personal space:
 *
 * #.#####
 * #.....#
 * #....>#
 * #...v.#
 * #.....#
 * #.....#
 * #####.#
 * Finally, after yet another minute, the rightward-facing blizzard on the right is replaced with a new one on the left
 * facing the same direction:
 *
 * #.#####
 * #.....#
 * #>....#
 * #.....#
 * #...v.#
 * #.....#
 * #####.#
 * This process repeats at least as long as you are observing it, but probably forever.
 *
 * Here is a more complex example:
 *
 * #.######
 * #>>.<^<#
 * #.<..<<#
 * #>v.><>#
 * #<^v^^>#
 * ######.#
 * Your expedition begins in the only non-wall position in the top row and needs to reach the only non-wall position
 * in the bottom row. On each minute, you can move up, down, left, or right, or you can wait in place. You and the
 * blizzards act simultaneously, and you cannot share a position with a blizzard.
 *
 * In the above example, the fastest way to reach your goal requires 18 steps. Drawing the position of the expedition
 * as E, one way to achieve this is:
 *
 * Initial state:
 * #E######
 * #>>.<^<#
 * #.<..<<#
 * #>v.><>#
 * #<^v^^>#
